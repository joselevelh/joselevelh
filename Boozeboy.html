							<h1>Boozeboy IoT Bar Inventory System</h1>
							<p class="major">Boozeboy uses specialized hardware which integrates seemlessly in the bar environment to capture real-time bottle volumes and make sure your bar is always stocked while the customers roll in.
							We created a customizable dashboard that allows managers to see their current bar inventory without having to visually check of weigh any bottles. This means that bars never have to take inventory again, and can keep track of over pouring and skimmage.</p>

							<h2>IoT Beverage Inventory System</h2>
							<p>The Boozeboy smart speed-rail is an IoT inventory system that monitors real time changes in the volumes of all the bottles currently being used in a bar or restaurant environment.
								 My team also implemented  a data visualization platform using Losant, that allows bar managers to see their real-time inventory needs and gain insights based on their long term customer consumption.
								  Booze boy allows bar owners to track how much alcohol is going in each drink, and at what time without relying on receipts. The data is captured using force sensors embedded within our specially designed speed-rails and then pushed to the cloud through MQTT.
									 This data is then displayed to bar owners on their specialized dashboard where they can see a real time view of what’s happening in their bar.</p>

								<h2>Remote Dispenser for Bio-waste Management</h2>
								<p>By recomendation from the Electrical Engineering Department at FIU, Eco-tabs hired my partner and I on a contract to design and build an automated dispenser for bio-waste treatment. The dispenser was needed in treat hazardous H2S gas from waste in airports where sending personnel was dangerous.
									 We worked with an industrial designer and machine shops to create multiple real-life prototypes to be test run on-site in toxic environments around the world. The main obstacles in this project were creating an electrical and software system with extreme power efficiency to reduce battery swaps(hazardous and expensive to perform) and creating a mechanical system that worked without fail in various harsh environments.
									 In this project our two-person team completed all electrical and software features from the PCB to Embedded Software ourselves and worked closely with a designer to finalize the mechanical system and casing.</p>

							<h2>Fish Piloted Water Tank</h2>
							<p> Our 2-man(and one fish) team won 1st place in hardware hack and 3rd place overall at the largest hackathon in Florida. We used an embedded microprocessor and infrared sensors to monitor a fish’s movement within a small tank and actuate motors accordingly to move the tank in the direction the fish swims.
							The infrared sensors were set up like a cage about a half inch from the walls of the fish tank. When the fish aproaches a wall of the tank, it trips the sensor which signals the procesessor to actuate the motors in that direction.</p>

								<h2>In-Fridge Rapid Cooling Device</h2>
								<p>During my internship program at GE Appliances, I had the opportunity to work with a team of other interns for a company hackathon. We decided to build an in-fridge rapid cooling system that focused on getting standard bottles and cans from room temperatureto fridge temperature in 60 seconds. Using a DC motor and a hack to the fridge's ice and water dispenser, we sprayed ice cold water on the surface of the vessel while spinning it to bring the liquid in the center(hottest part) towards the surface. This movement allowed us to bring the can towards fridge temeperatures faster than regular air or water exposure could. In this project, I led the control systems and UI of the device.</p>
